# 2048-Game
2048 for iOS designed to resemble a handheld game console. Combining tiles in the four different directions is done by pressing the D-Pad in the intended direction. Tiles get progressively more red in color as they approach 2048. A timer is provided so users can see how long it takes them to win the game by creating a 2048 tile. Additionally, users can pause the game to stop the timer, but they will not be able to see the screen to prevent them from thinking ahead while the timer is stopped.
